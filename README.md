For numbers from 1 to 20:

Print that number
If number divides by 3, print pa instead
If number divides by 5, print pow instead
If number divides by both 3 and 5, print papow instead
Put spaces in between of the elements (but not before first or after the last one).

Expected output:

1 2 pa 4 pow pa 7 8 pa pow 11 pa 13 14 papow 16 17 pa 19 pow

Maintain the code from task v1, it's still used in the system.

Besides that, for numbers from 1 to 15:

Print that number
If number is even (divides by 2), print hatee instead
If number divides by 7, print ho instead
If number is even and divides by 7, print hateeho instead
Put dashes in between of the elements (but not before first or after the last one).

Expected output:

1-hatee-3-hatee-5-hatee-ho-hatee-9-hatee-11-hatee-13-hateeho-15
As task v1 should be mainained, full expected output would be something like this:

Task v1:
1 2 pa 4 pow pa 7 8 pa pow 11 pa 13 14 papow 16 17 pa 19 pow
Task v2:
1-hatee-3-hatee-5-hatee-ho-hatee-9-hatee-11-hatee-13-hateeho-15
It would be really great if there would be no copy-and-paste (you can use copy-and-paste, just avoid duplicated code in the end result).

Expected output:

1-hatee-3-hatee-5-hatee-ho-hatee-9-hatee-11-hatee-13-hateeho-15
